	<h1> Welcome to Seth's Gist Finder </h1>
	<p> Note: the search button will provide a result of 30 gists from
		the gist API at github. Each found gist in the search is displayed in the results
		section as the description of that gist that doubles as an embedded link to the HTML version that gist.
		Thus, any gist found with no description will appear with a "No description" tag next to an add button.
		Any result found with a description that is already in the favorites menu will not be displayed even 
		if found in the search. Add and remove gists to the favorites menu with the provided buttons.
		Language filtering and pagnation does not operate so selecting those options will not do anything.</p>
